Reading is a great way to learn. One of my goals is to constantly be learning and teaching. For me to achieve this goal I can’t be content to sit around and do the same thing every day. I need to be exposing myself to thoughts that are not necessarily my own and listening to others to glean insights from them.

I&#8217;m going to read one book per week and post my notes from the book to [keiththomps.com][1] so that I have something to look back on and also to allow others to learn from my thoughts of the book if they haven’t read the book themselves.

## Reading List

A lot of the books I look to read are considered required reading for entrepreneurs and come highly regarded by highly successful people. Other books on this list are here because I’m curious about the topic, so expect to see quite a few technology related books.

  * [The School of Greatness][2] ([My Review][3])
  * [Good To Great][4] ([My Review][5])
  * [How to Win Friends & Influence People][6] ([My Review][7])
  * [The 12 Week Year][8] ([My Review][9])
  * [Deep Work][10]
  * [The Productivity Project][11]
  * [Mindset][12]
  * [Programming Elixir][13] (Currently Reading)
  * [Programming Phoenix][14] (Currently Reading)
  * [Drive][15]
  * [The Sketchnote Handbook][16]
  * [Think and Grow Rich][17]
  * [Awaken the Giant Within][18]

Some of these books would be great as audio books.
