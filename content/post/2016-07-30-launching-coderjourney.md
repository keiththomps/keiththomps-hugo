I&#8217;ve been working behind the scenes for a few weeks to begin producing educational programming content, and today was the day that published my first YouTube video.

Check out [the channel][1] and tell me what you think of the first video (if you&#8217;re interested in learning about technology).

Special thanks to Ian Zainea for making the intro animation for my videos.
