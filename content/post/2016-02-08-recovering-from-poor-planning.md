My goal of reading one book a week didn&#8217;t make it that far without a few hiccups. Reading _Good to Great_ took me a day longer than I was expecting and the book I had scheduled to follow that was a pretty big technical book. I was unable to finish reading all of _Programming Elixir_ within the week that I allotted for it.

## Poor Planning of a Good Goal

Normally, this would be the point where people would throw in the towel on a New Year&#8217;s resolution because they&#8217;ve already &#8220;failed&#8221;, but it shows me that I did a poor job of planning a reasonable goal. I&#8217;m not the fastest reader by nature (I subvocalize, and I tend to get distracted and need to re-read passages), so 1 book a week would be fine if I only planned on reading books that we  small. That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m actually going for, I want to read 52 books in a year. Some books will take me longer than others, and I shouldn&#8217;t be concerned by that unless I get to the point where I can&#8217;t possibly read 52 books by December 31, 2016.

It&#8217;s important to set _good_ goals and the way that I worded my reading goal set me up for failure. If I chose to read something that got me out of my comfort zone there was a good chance it would take longer than a week, so I&#8217;m adjusting the wording of my goal to be this:

> I will read 52 books in a year, _averaging_ 1 book per week.
